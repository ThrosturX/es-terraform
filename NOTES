### Notes for this "plugin", hopefully mergable content

## New factions/government:
Note: systems start out as "Independent" but some of them change
-   mining company
-   delivery company
-   hostile aliens, slavers
    -> They learn english after "a long time", due to having captured some delivery boys or something
    -> Split into 2 or 3 "clans", differences are small, 1-2 major technology/ship unqiue to each clan
        * All are brave/heroic, don't care about loot and spoils, only about winning fights
        * One clan opposes slavery and has lower crew requirements
        * One clan has better engines, but no turret mounts (or max 1-2 on the biggest ships)
        * One clan focuses on "boarding vessels", a secondary weapon whose ammunition requires crew (and that crew is expended when the weapon is fired) (alternatively, the ammunition is a boarding drone filled with slaves)
            -> boarding vessels have high shield piercing and do hull damage. Hopefully also kill some crew after a time.
        * Shields are weak, like very weak, hull is strong to compensate
        * Slaves being popular and accessible increase required crew count for ships for that faction
-   aliens A:
    -   friendly merchants
    -   hostile pirates
    -   Eventually learn english from doing business with the new human settlements
    -   Fairly bad technology, but some of it is upgrade from human technology

## New space:
-   New space is accessed either by wormhole directly, or by traveling along a fairly long "corridor" after jumping through a wormhole
-   A couple of systems should be for mining, and a new government "mining company" will settle there
-   Some systems get named after original settlers, like "Jayne's World"
-   Near the entry system, there should be a settled delivery company
-   Most systems that can be settled stay "Independent" indefinitely (future content) or get converted into Pirate worlds after a timer (systems in "unpopular" places, near edges and so on)
-   Near the far reaches of accessible space, there should be an "aliens A" trading hub or two. 
-   Further than the "aliens A" trading hub, there should be space where hostile aliens live.
    -> Backstory: the "Aliens A" settlement are escaped slaves from hostile alien slavers, their homeworlds are somewhere else, perhaps slightly further and to the side from the hostile aliens
